# What's Vim?
- A terminal-based text editor, around since 1991
- Based on an older Vi, written in 1976
- By far the most popular text editor for \*nix users
- Self-documenting (:help)
- Customize keybindings and extend with plugins (.vimrc)
- Modal editor (has multiple modes) (you will learn these later)
  - Normal
  - Insert
  - Visual

# Quiz!
What does each of the following sequences of keys do (assume we start in normal mode)
1. `ihi`
2. `dd`
3. `:q!`
4. `:%s/foo/bar/g`
5. `caw`
6. `qsA;<ESC>qj@s`
7. `yip`
8. `<C-w>l`
9. `:set expandtab`
10. `u`


# Answers
What does each of the following sequences of keys do (assume we start in normal mode)
1. `ihi` : enter insert mode, insert "hi"
2. `dd` : delete line, send to default register (`"`)
3. `:q!` : force quit
4. `:%s/foo/bar/g` : replace all instances of "foo" with "bar" multiple times per line
5. `caw` : "change a word", deletes word under cursor and enters insert mode
6. `qsA;<ESC>qj@s` : create macro `s`, which appends `;` to the end of the line, move down a line, run macro `s`
7. `"tyip` : "yank inner paragraph", yanks paragraph to register `t`
8. `<C-w>l` : move to window to the right
9. `:set expandtab` : sets expandtab to true, which causes tabs to be inserted as spaces
10. `u` : undo last command

# Philosophy of Vim
- Edit text using a sequence of operations and motions
- An operation needs a motion or selection to operate over
- Have modes to do different things
- Stay in normal mode, quickly go into other modes to do edits
- Normal, Command, Visual, Insert
- There can be multiple ways to do the same thing
  - But usually there's one best way
- Manipulate text by composing many operations, motions, selections

# Starting Vim
- On command line: vim [filename]
- Or: vim
  - then type :e \<filename\>

# Entering Insert Mode
- Vim starts in Normal Mode
- Entering insert mode:
  - `i` : insert at cursor
  - `I` : insert at beginning of line
  - `a` : append after cursor
  - `A` : append at the end of line
- Exiting insert mode:
  - Esc or C-c
- Moving around in normal mode:
  - `h` : left
  - `j` : down
  - `k` : up
  - `l` : right


# Command Mode
- Invoke by using `:`ù in normal mode
- Basic necessary commands
  - `:w[rite] [filename]`
  - `:q[uit]`
  - :q[uit]! : don't save
- Some useful commands
  - `:h[elp] [subject]`
    - This is your best best friend for learning vim
  - `:se[t] {option}`
    - Used for setting vim settings in the current session


# Exercise 1
- Open ex1_getting_started.txt
- Remember:
  - `h` `j` `k` `l` to move in normal mode
  - `i` to insert, a to append
  - `I` to insert at beginning of line, A to insert at end of line
  - `ESC` to exit insert mode back to normal mode
- Typical flow: stay in normal mode, enter insert mode, edit, and then go back to normal.

# Normal Mode Basics
- Normal mode common commands
  - dd : delete line
  - yy : yank line
  - p : paste below
  - P : paste above
  - o : open line below--creates a new line below cursor and enters insert mode
  - O : open line above--creates a new line above cursor and enters insert mode
  - u : undo last command
  - C-r : redo last command

# Search and Replace
- Start with /
- Press enter
- n : next result
- N : previous result
- Supports regexes
- Some settings:
- :set incsearch : set incremental search--starts searching for partially typed queries
- :set hlsearch : set highlight search
- :noh : clears highlighted search


# Operator/Motion Composing
- Vim has operations and motions
- This allows a lot of flexibility in your commands
- Operators:
- d : delete
- y : yank
- c : change
- gU : uppercase
- = : format
- > : shift right
- Motions/Text object motions(just a few)
- w : word
- b : previous word
- aw : "a workd"
- 4j : 4 lines down
- /foo : next occurence of `foo`
- tc : "unTil c"
- fr : right aFter "r"

# Operator/Motion Examples
- Additionally, can use numbers to repeat many operators
  - 3dd : delete 3 lines
- Also, repeat the operator to operate on that line
  - yy, dd, cc, >>, gUU should be self-explanatory
- Composing operators and motions:
  - ciw : change inner word
  - gUi) : make the text inside a pair of parentheses uppercase
  - yap : yank a paragraph
  - d4W : delete the next 4 WORDs

# Working with Indentation
- Need to :set shiftwidth to choose how far to change indent
- << and >> change indentation for current line
- {visual}< and {visual}> change indentation for selection
- Use .ù to repeat indentation change
- Exercise: ex3_bad_indent.c

# Macros
- Macros allow you to repeat repetitive keystroke sequences
- Examples tend to be things like, adjust the format of particular lines
- Use q<register> followed by the keys you want to use
- Using ESC to go from normal mode to insert mode sometimes screws things up
- If that happens, use C-c instead
- To run a macro, use @<register>
- Repeat last macro: @@
- Repeat multiple times: 50@@

# Visual and Visual Block mode
- v : enter visual mode
- V : enter visual line mode
- C-v : enter visual block mode	
- Special: for visual block mode, use A or I to add to the end of each line
- Helpful: use the motions ^ for beginning of line and $ for end of line
- Use this mode to select text to then use an operator on
- Useful for selecting text precisely


# Exercise: Vim Golf
- Use your documentation-reading abilities to find a solution to the following problem.
- In ex4\_vim\_golf.txt, transform the text in the fewest keystrokes possible!
- Find a way to replace all instances 
- be sure to look at :h motions.txt


# Vim Tips
- Change your keyboard settings to have low repeat delay and high repeat rate for a more enjoyable Vim experience

# Customizing Vim

"Hey wanna check out my dotfiles"
- Use .vimrc to customize your vim experience
- .vimrc is executed as commands when vim is started up
- Can contain plugins, settings, keybinds
- Vimawesome.com lists the most popular vim plugins


# Vim Colors
- Vim has very extensible syntax highlighting
- :setf[iletype] {filetype}
- This changes the syntax type as well
- Use this when vim has the wrong syntax identified
- Install support for other syntax files using plugins
- Colorschemes - change the way vim looks
- Set with :colo[rscheme] {name}
- Many many colorschemes around.
- Some personal favorites: Molokai, Solarized.
- Install the same way as plugins


# How to Learn More?
- Countless talks on Vim productivity
- Most popular text editor -- there's a large community
- Print out a cheatsheet!
- Keep using it! Don't give up!
- vimcasts.org
- Webcasts of practical examples of things to do with Vim
- vimawesome


# Extra Content (time permitting)


# Dotfiles
- Put them in a repo so that you can easily copy them and keep them updated on all your machines you work on
- Lets you move your config around easily!
- Good to have an understanding of how git works to do this
- First thing I do when I log into a machine is clone my dotfiles!


# Whitespace Management
- :set list helps view tabs vs spaces
- Should also set listchars in .vimrc
- See ex5\_whitespace.py


# Vim Tabs and Windows
- Can have multiple buffers open at once as tabs
- From :help windows.txt
- A buffer is the in-memory text of a file.
- A window is a viewport on a buffer.
- A tab page is a collection of windows.
- A window is a viewport onto a buffer.  You can use multiple windows on one buffer, or several windows on different buffers.
- A buffer is a file loaded into memory for editing.  The original file remains unchanged until you write the buffer to the file.
- Use C-w s for split, C-w n for new, C-w = for set windows equal size


# Autocompletion
- Gazillions of articles online about how to do this
Options
- youcompleteme
- OmniComplete (Vim >8.0)
- Read more about these, I personally don't use them.
you can use the `*` command to search for a keyword


# Vim in Chrome
Vimium is a plugin that lets you use the vim keybinds for Chromium
Very fast web browsing


# How to develop dotfiles
- Start with a base
- Modify and add things until you are happy with what you have
- Keep modifying it forever, you will never be 100% happy with it
- Many online resources (or just search for dotfiles on github!)
